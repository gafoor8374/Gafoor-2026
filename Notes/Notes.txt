  #####     EPISODE 01  #######
What is React?
React is a JavaScript librabry.

 What is crossOrigin?
 In security, an origin is defined by a combination of the protocol and domain and prot.
 it is request when a resource from one origin to request from different origin.
 eg:https://eaxmple.com:8080

 What is ReactElement?
 ReactElement is javascript object.


1. What is Reconciliation?

In React, Reconciliation is:

The process of comparing the previous Virtual DOM with the new Virtual DOM and updating only the changed parts in the real DOM.

🧠 Why React doesn’t update DOM directly?

Because:

Real DOM updates are slow

React creates a Virtual DOM (JavaScript object)

It compares changes in memory (fast)

Then updates only necessary nodes

Example:
root.render(<h1>Hello</h1>);

Later:

root.render(<h1>Hello Gafoor</h1>);

React compares:

Old:

<h1>Hello</h1>

New:

<h1>Hello Gafoor</h1>

It sees:

Same tag (h1)

Only text changed

So it updates only the text node, not the full element.

That comparison process = Reconciliation

2️⃣ What is Fiber?

React 16 introduced a new engine called Fiber.

👉 Fiber is the internal algorithm that:

Breaks rendering work into small units

Can pause work

Can resume work

Can prioritize updates

Before Fiber:

Rendering was synchronous (blocking)

After Fiber:

Rendering can be asynchronous (non-blocking)

3️⃣ What is Concurrent Rendering? (React 18 Feature)

In React 18, we have:

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);

This enables Concurrent Rendering

What does that mean?

React can:

Pause rendering

Continue later

Prioritize important updates

Keep UI responsive

Example:

User typing in input (high priority)

Big list rendering (low priority)

React will prioritize typing first.

4️⃣ Real DOM vs Virtual DOM (Interview Table)
Feature	Real DOM	Virtual DOM
Speed	Slow	Fast
Update	Repaints full structure	Updates only changed nodes
Control	Browser	React
5️⃣ Strong 30-Second Interview Answer

React uses a Virtual DOM to optimize performance. When state changes, React creates a new Virtual DOM and compares it with the previous one using a process called reconciliation. The Fiber architecture allows React to break rendering into small units and prioritize updates. In React 18, concurrent rendering improves responsiveness by enabling interruptible rendering.


what is createRoot()?
1.createRoot() is creating a root object through the ReactDOM.
2.It is create a fiber tree.
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));

what is root.render()?
root.render() returns undefined because it is a side-effect function that renders React elements into the DOM and does not return any value. In JavaScript, functions without a return statement automatically return undefined.
1. React create the fiber tree
2.it compares reconciliation process.
3.it update the real DOM.
