 import and export are two types
 1. defalut export and named export 
  EX: export defalut Header; export const namedthing;
 2. default import and named import 
 EX: import Header from "./Header"; and import {Header } from namedthing;


 ##React Hooks
 (Normal js utility functons)
 1. useState()
 2. useEffect()

 usestate() when state variable is update our dom will be update or re-rendering the dom.

 usestate() is given arr;
 ex: const arr = useState();
 const [list, setList] = arr; or 
 const list = arr[0];
 const setList - arr[1];

 The crucial point about State variables is that
whenever they update, React triggers a reconciliation
cycle and re-renders the component.
- This means that as soon as the data layer changes,
React promptly updates the UI layer. The data layer is
always kept in sync with the UI layer.
- To achieve this rapid operation, React employs a
reconciliation algorithm, also known as the diffing
algorithm or React-Fibre which we will delve into further
below.
