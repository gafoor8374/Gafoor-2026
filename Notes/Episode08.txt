 class based component:
 class based component is using extens method to create a react component using render method inside return a some piece of jsx code.
 
 ex: class Userclass extend React.component{}

 In classs based component pass props inside componet receiving as constructor function using.
 once received the props we declare the super(props).

 ex:- constructor(props){
    super(props);
 }
 when use props like 
 ex:this.props.name.


 creating state variable in class component:
 this.state is creaating object in constructor
 ex: constructor(props){
        super(props);

        
        this.state={
          count:0,
        };

    };

    State variable never directly updated.

LifeCycle n class component:
there are two phase :
 1. Render phase
 2. Commit phase

 Render Phase:
 first call constructor , second is render method   
 Commit Phase :
 React updating DOM then call componentDidmount() called this life cycle
EX:-
 Parent Constructor
 Parent Render
 Child Constructor
 Child Render
 child mount
 parent Mount



 /***
 *  ##### Mounting ####
 * consturtor (create dummy data)
 * render (dummy data)
 * 
 * DOM update (dummy data)
 * ComponentDidMount (api call)
 * 
 *    ##### updating ####
 * render(update the state with api data)
 * componentDidUpdate(update api data) => updateing 
 * 
 * 
 * comoponetWillUpdate()=> unmount the data
 
 *

 Chapter 08 - Let's get Classy
Theory Assignment:
● How do you create Nested Routes react-router-dom cofiguration
● Read abt createHashRouter, createMemoryRouter from React Router docs.
● What is the order of life cycle method calls in Class Based Components
● Why do we use componentDidMount?
● Why do we use componentWillUnmount? Show with example
● (Research) Why do we use super(props) in constructor?
● (Research) Why can't we have the callback function of useEffect async?
Coding Assignment:
● Create a Class Based Component
○ Create 2 class based child components
○ Pass props from Parent to child
○ Create a constructor
○ Create a state variable inside child
○ Use this.setState to update it
○ What if there are multiple state variables?
○ Write a console.log for each lifecycle method
○ Play with the console logs to find out the correct order of their execution
● Create interval inside componentDidMount?
○ Use clearInterval to fix the issue caused by that interval
